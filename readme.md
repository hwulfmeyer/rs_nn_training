# Installing

Install required packages via pip etc.
- numpy, matplotlib, tqdm, tensorflow, etc....

for object_detection package:
- git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
- follow installation process in https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md
- what worked for me:
  - install object_detection via pip
  - create protos files via the installation process above
  - copy protos files into the object_detection package folder
